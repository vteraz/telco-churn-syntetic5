# Telco Customer Churn - Synthetic Dataset with MLOps Pipeline

## Overview
This repository provides a synthetic dataset generator for Telco Customer Churn prediction, along with a full MLOps pipeline. It includes tools for data generation with built-in data drift, model training, experiment tracking using MLflow, API serving with FastAPI, monitoring, and deployment. The dataset is entirely synthetic (no real customer data) and is inspired by the public Telco Customer Churn dataset on Kaggle, licensed under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0.

Key features:

Generate 100,000+ records spanning 2023-01-01 to 2024-12-31.

Simulate gradual concept drift (e.g., growth in fiber optic adoption, decline in electronic checks, reducing churn rates).

Realistic feature dependencies and a RecordDate column for time-based analysis.

MLOps integration: Data Version Control (DVC), Airflow for orchestration, MLflow for experiment tracking and model registry, Kubernetes for deployment, and monitoring for drift detection.

## Installation

Clone the repository:textgit clone https://github.com/mentorchita/telco-churn-mlops-synthetic-05.git

cd telco-churn-mlops-synthetic-05

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:textpython -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt

pip install -r requirements-ml.txt  # For MLflow and training dependencies

pip install -r requirements-api.txt  # For FastAPI

pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # Optional: For linting, Jupyter, etc.


## Usage

### Data Generation

Generate synthetic data using the provided scripts.

Standard generation:

python src/generate_dataset.py

Custom generation:

python src/generate_dataset.py --samples 100000 --output-dir data/ --start-date 2022-01-01 --end-date 2024-12-31

Enhanced generation (using config.yaml):

python src/generate_dataset_ext.py --samples 20000 --conv-samples 3000

Output files will be placed in data/ (e.g., telco_customers.csv, support_conversations.csv).

### Makefile Commands

Use make for streamlined workflows:

- make help: List all commands.
- make install: Install base dependencies.
- make install-dev: Install development tools (e.g., Ruff, Black, Jupyter).
- make generate-ext: Generate extended dataset.
- make explore: Launch Jupyter.
- make lint: Check code style.
- make format: Fix code style.
- make clean-data: Clean generated data.
- make train: Train the churn model (logs to MLflow).
- make docker-up: Start all services via Docker Compose.
- make jupyter-up: Launch Jupyter container.
- make jupyter-down: Stop Jupyter.
- make jupyter-logs: View Jupyter logs (includes access token).

## ML Training
Запустіть `make train` для тренування моделі churn prediction.

## Testing the Predict API

The `/predict` endpoint accepts customer features as JSON and returns churn prediction.

### Quick test with curl:

```bash
docker t \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "tenure": 12,
    "MonthlyCharges": 65.5,
    "TotalCharges": 786.0,
    "gender": "Male",
    "SeniorCitizen": 0,
    "Partner": "Yes",
    "Dependents": "No",
    "PhoneService": "Yes",
    "MultipleLines": "No",
    "InternetService": "Fiber optic",
    "OnlineSecurity": "No",
    "OnlineBackup": "No",
    "DeviceProtection": "No",
    "TechSupport": "No",
    "StreamingTV": "No",
    "StreamingMovies": "No",
    "Contract": "Month-to-month",
    "PaperlessBilling": "Yes",
    "PaymentMethod": "Electronic check"
  }'
```

### Python script test:

```bash
# Install requests if not already installed
pip install requests

# Run the test script
python test_api_predict.py
```

The test script will:

1. Check `/health` endpoint (confirms API is running and model is loaded)
   
2. Send sample customer data to `/predict`
   
3. Display the churn prediction result (probability and binary classification)

### Via Docker Compose:

```bash
# Start all services (generator, jupyter, api, mlflow)
docker-compose up --build

# In another terminal, test the API
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

## Deployment

Use deployment/ for Kubernetes manifests to deploy the API and MLflow in production.

## Monitoring

Scripts in monitoring/ handle data/concept drift detection, A/B testing, and shadow datasets. Integrate with MLflow for comparing model versions.
